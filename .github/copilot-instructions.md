# Copilot Instructions for Node.js Project

This document outlines specific guidelines for using Copilot in this Node.js project. These rules must be adhered to in order to maintain consistency and meet project standards.

## Guidelines

1. **Avoid `Object.forEach()`**
   - Do not use the `Object.forEach()` method. Only for loop to use is like for(let i = 0; i < data.length; i++)

2. **Do Not Change Variable Names**
   - Retain the original variable names as they are in the code. Do not modify or suggest alternative variable names.

3. **Do Not Change function Names**
   - Retain the original function names as they are in the code. Do not modify or suggest alternative function names.

4. **Maintain Text Case**
   - Do not adjust the case of any text. Preserve the original casing as provided, whether it is upper case, lower case, or mixed case.

5. **Do Not suggest functions**
   - There are plenty of functions and when needed I create others, please focus on programming and not structure

6. **Code Formatting Style**
   - Do not split simple code across multiple lines
   - use two spaces for indents

7. **who I am**
   - I use as few of words as I can, not out of disrespect, I think of it as honoring someone elses time

8. **Avoid extra code**
   - Avoid pointless variables, (e.g., Y = X) just to use it in code when X can be used directly
   - Avoid creating functions when the main purpose is to call another function

9. **No Additional Dependencies**
   - Do not suggest installing or adding new dependencies, packages, or extensions
